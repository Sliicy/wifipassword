# How to use:
This only works on Linux. Tested on Debian Wheezy.

Simply allow execution of wifipassword (either by rightclicking and selecting "allow executing file as a program", or with chmod +x) and run from Terminal.

# Code Explanation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#The header needed to run.

WIFI="$(iwgetid -r)"
#Create a variable called "WIFI" equal to the name of the current Network.

echo ${WIFI}
#Print out the Wi-Fi Name.

awk '/psk=/{print $NF}' /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/${WIFI} | cut -c 5-
#Print out the saved password of this wifi and trim the results (so you don't see "psk=").
```
# You can also drag this file into /usr/bin to execute it from the Terminal anytime you want!
